## Migration Guide

### From v2.0 to v2.5

**✅ BACKWARD COMPATIBLE**: Version 2.5 is backward compatible with v2.0.

New features in v2.5 are **opt-in** through the Feature Flags system:

```csharp
var options = new LibEmiddleClientOptions
{
    // Existing v2.0 configuration works unchanged
    TransportType = TransportType.Http,
    ServerEndpoint = "https://your-server.com",
    
    // New v2.5 features are opt-in
    FeatureFlags = new FeatureFlags
    {
        EnableMessageBatching = true,           // Opt-in to message batching
        EnableDiagnostics = true,              // Opt-in to monitoring
        EnableAdvancedGroupManagement = true,  // Opt-in to enhanced groups
        EnableAsyncMessageStreams = true,      // Opt-in to reactive streams
        EnableWebRTCTransport = true          // Opt-in to WebRTC support
    },
    
    // Configure new optional features
    WebRTCOptions = new WebRTCOptions { /* configuration */ },
    BatchingOptions = new BatchingOptions { /* configuration */ },
    PostQuantumOptions = new PostQuantumOptions { /* configuration */ }
};
```

#### Benefits of Upgrading to v2.5:
- **Performance**: Message batching and connection pooling improvements
- **Monitoring**: Built-in diagnostics and health monitoring
- **Future-Ready**: Post-quantum cryptography preparation
- **Flexibility**: WebRTC transport for peer-to-peer scenarios
- **Enterprise**: Advanced features for high-scale deployments

### From v1.x to v2.x

**⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES**: Version 2.0 is not backward compatible with v1.x.

#### Key Changes:
1. **API Redesign**: Complete rewrite of public APIs
2. **Protocol Update**: New protocol version with enhanced security
3. **Data Migration**: Existing sessions and keys need migration

#### Migration Steps:
1. **Backup existing data** before upgrading
2. **Review new API documentation** in README.md
3. **Update your code** to use new `LibEmiddleClient` API
4. **Run migration tools** (if available) for existing data
5. **Test thoroughly** in development environment

#### Code Changes Required:
```csharp
// Old v1.x API (deprecated)
var oldClient = new LibEmiddleManager();
await oldClient.InitializeAsync();

// New v2.x API
var options = new LibEmiddleClientOptions
{
    UserId = "user123",
    DeviceId = "device456"
};
var newClient = new LibEmiddleClient(options);
await newClient.InitializeAsync();
```
